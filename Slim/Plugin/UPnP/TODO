DLNA

Study libdlna for reference

MediaRenderer
-------------
Change upnp:// mode playback to a single-track model:
* NextAVTransportURI is internal-only, not exposed as playlist index 2
* Playlists are also internal, Next/Previous switch between internal tracks, Pandora-like
When not in upnp:// mode, i.e. control point connects during playback of native SBS tracks, radio, etc:
* Only return current track metadata, empty values for Next track
* NumberOfTracks = playlist size
* Next/Previous work like skip
* (is this worth worrying about? maybe should just return nothing if not in upnp:// mode)
DLNA extras
Verify list of content-types is correct
If a control point tries to have us play an item from our own MediaServer, need some special-case handling?

MediaServer
