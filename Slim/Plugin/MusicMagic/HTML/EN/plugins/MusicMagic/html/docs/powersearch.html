<h2>MusicIP Mixer Help - Power Search</h2>

<p>Power Search is an advanced feature of MusicIP Mixer, and requires an active registration key. <p>

<div>Power Searching allows you to create simple text-only filters which you can use in a variety of settings.  For instance, you can go to the onscreen
search control, and enter '?' to start a Power Search (currently, this 
requires you to enable Power Search from the Power Tools preference panel).
Then, you can type in a Power Search and press Enter to
execute the search.  For instance, try this:

<blockquote><p>
<b>?songs by women</b></p>
</blockquote>

When you press Enter, the search will be applied, much like a filter.
You can mix into the Power Search if you have Power Tools enabled -
right-click on the Mix button and choose "Current List"</div>

<div>You can also use Power Search in the HTTP API any place a filter is allowed -
just make sure to start the Power Search with a question mark.  For instance,
<blockquote><p>
<b>/api/songs?filter=?songs+by+women</b></p>
</blockquote></div>

<div>If you having problems creating a valid Power Search, try to keep
it simple.  The easiest rules will look like:

<blockquote><p>
<b>condition1 and condition2</b></p>
</blockquote>
or
<blockquote><p>
<b>condition1 or condition2</b></p>
</blockquote>

You can create more complicated conditions using parentheses.</div>

<hr />

<p>The following is a list of allowed keywords and their meanings.
Most of these correspond with columns which can show up in the list of
tracks, although a few can only be accessed through Power Searches.
Fields are accurate as of the most recent refresh.</p>
