<h2>MusicIP Mixer Help - Power Words</h2>

<P>MusicIP Mixer has support for an extensible vocabulary inside Power
Search.  You can define your own words in terms of existing terms, and
they will be usable in their own Power Searches.</P>

<p>To to this, create a file called powerwords.txt, and store
it where the default cache is located (on Windows, this is the
installation folder).  Each line will contain a definition
or an alias.  You can add comments by starting the line with any
symbol besides _.</P>

<P><B>Aliases</B>: You can create a new alias which represents any
existing word, by writing the line
<pre>
und=and
</pre>

In this case, it means whenever the word &quot;und&quot; is used,
it has the same meaning as &quot;and&quot;.  You can define
as many aliases as you like, but the right-hand side should alway
be a basic word or definition (not another alias).  The entire
<a href="powersearch.html">Power Search vocabulary</a> is available.</P>

<P><b>Definitions:</b> A definition lets you create a new word which
represents an existing boolean expression.  You can use these to create
a more intuitive vocabulary based on how you think about your own
music collection.  You can create a new definition like this:
<pre>
crappy: bps <= 96
recent: added > now - 7 days
</pre>

Thus, &quot;crappy&quot; now means songs with a bitrate less than or equal to 96. &quot;recent&quot; now means songs added within the last 7 days.</P>

<P>With these definitions in place, you can do a search &quot;recent crappy songs&quot; to select all low bitrate downloads in the last 7 days (presumably to delete them!).</P>

<p>
Here are some more examples:
<pre>
favorite: rating > 3
rap: genre contains "rap"
country: genre contains "country"
rock: genre contains "rock"
classical: genre contains "classical"
christmas: title contains "jingle" or title contains "christmas"
artwork: hasimage

tiny: bytes < 1000000
