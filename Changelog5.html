<h2><a name="v5.4.0" id="v5.4.0"></a>Version 5.4.0 - 2004-11-9</h2>
<ul>

	<li>Radio Plugins:
		<ul>
			<li>New plugin: Slim Devices Picks.
			<li>New plugin: Live365 Internet Radio is now part of the default installation (thanks to Jim Kneply).
			<li>radioio plugin: fixed branding and wrong port for Acoustic station.
			<li>Added an "Internet Radio" link in the
	  "Help" section of the SlimServer home page. Besides
	  information on radio options, it presents a simple web UI to
	  play a radio stream if you know its URL, without having to
	  create a playlist file.
		</ul>
	</li>

	<li>RSS Reader Plugin: Dave Cohen contributed an RSS Reader plugin that
		is now part of the release. It can be used to browse a
		configurable set of RSS feeds. It can also be set as a
		screensaver to present a ticker of articles. The list
		of feeds can be changed by browsing to Slim Server
		&gt; Plugins through the SlimServer web interface.
	</li>

	<li>Menu system changes:
		<ul>
			<li>Simplified home menu structure. The
			top-level items are Now Playing, Browse Music,
			Search Music, Playlists, Internet Radio,
			Settings and Plugins.
    			<li>Plugins are now placed in different menu
    			categories - Games, Screensavers, Internet
    			Radio, etc. The Internet Radio plugin category
    			is now at the top-level.
			<li>Remove Browse Songs from Browse Music
	  submenu (it's too slow to be useful.)
			<li>When in Browse Music, use a dynamically
			generated menu.
			<li>kdf reimplemented much of the home menu system to be more flexible using INPUT.List.
			<li>Added a way to run an upgrade
	  script on a per-client basis. Added a script that replaces
	  Shoutcast in the home menu with Internet Radio.
		</ul>
	</li>

	<li>Remote Streaming and Formats:
		<ul>
			<li>Based on a submission from Craig
	  Eales, added the ability to do format conversion/transcoding of a
	  remote stream. This enables Ogg radio streaming!
			<li>Support for the mms: protocol (on Windows
	  only for now) using wmadec's ability to deal with URLs.With
	  ASX support already added, we should be able to play WMA
	  radio streams...on Windows only for now, unfortunately.
			<li>Added support for parsing WPL (submitted
	  by Danny Rego) and ASX playlists. Also made playlist
	  handling a little bit more contained so that adding support
	  for a new type requires adding code to just Parse.pm.
			<li>When streaming remote streams, start when
	  the buffer is 75% full or after 5 seconds and at least 5%
	  full. This allows rate limiting streams to start faster.
			<li>Support for mono streams in wmadec
			<li>Updated WMA code
	  to handle sample_rate.
			<li>Fixed proxy support for remote streams.
			<li>bug <a href="http://bugs.slimdevices.com/show_bug.cgi?id=552">552</a>: DRM protected WMA files are now
	  reported as such in songinfo and trackinfo playback of a DRM
	  WMA will produce an error on the player display and server
	  will skip to next song in the playlist.
			<li>Bugs <a href="http://bugs.slimdevices.com/show_bug.cgi?id=388">#388</a>, <a href="http://bugs.slimdevices.com/show_bug.cgi?id=447">447</a>, <a href="http://bugs.slimdevices.com/show_bug.cgi?id=581">581</a> Add binaries for flac
	  1.1.1, and update convert.conf to enable --skip and --until
	  Also add oggdec binaries.
			<li>Fixed problem where oggdec to lame
	  transcoding was not correctly byte-swapping on some
	  platforms (PowerPC specifically).
		</ul>
	</li>

	<li>SoftSqueeze 1.10 (thanks to Richard Titmuss)
		<ul>
			<li>Music search contributed by Brian Hein (alpha status).
			<li>Simpler configuration dialog.
			<li>An error is reported if Softsqueeze is not correctly installed.
			<li>Reset window positions if the window has been lost off the screen.
			<li>Display a warning if Softsqueeze needs upgrading to work with the slimserver.
			<li>Fixed configuration of non standard slimserver http port.
			<li>Fixed window dragging for OS X, use Option key to drag windows.
			<li>Fixed error reported by java web start on OS X.
			<li>Fixed music restarting when connection to server is lost. 
		</ul>
	</li>

	<li>Firmware 40:
		<ul>
			<li>Fix a problem with 32 character long SSIDs.
			<li>When reconnecting, the player tells the
	  server if it rebooted.  The server will now only restart
	  streams if the player has rebooted.
			<li>Updated squeezebox firmware to ignore
	  unknown frame types, rather than getting confused.  When
	  squeezebox connects, slimserver sends the latest version
	  number of the server.
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Add some nice text explaining to folks what they can do if the
	  server doesn't find their player. (HTTP streaming, SoftSqueeze,
	  fix their player)
	<li>Improved scanning performance:
		<ul>
				<li>Optimized reading of ID3 tags in Perl.
				<li>Moved scanning of ID3 tags within
            files into the same step as getting metadata from
            iTunes. This makes the scan take a bit longer,
            but subsequent operations are much faster, since we don't
            have to read tags from the files on-the-fly. This only
            applies to the iTunes case.
		</ul>
	<li>Nicolas Guillemain updated the french translations. German updates from Pascal Berger...
	<li>Various bug fixes:
		<ul>
			<li>Fixed problem where proxys were blocking
	  access to settings pages.
			<li>For Fishbone skin: fix bug <a href="http://bugs.slimdevices.com/show_bug.cgi?id=655">655</a>: IE reports
	  problems loading javascript
			<li>Fixed problem where we weren't detecting
          iTunes file changes in some cases.
			<li>Don't require a trailing slash when
	  specifying skins.
			<li>fix bug <a href="http://bugs.slimdevices.com/show_bug.cgi?id=368">368</a>, move image in songinfo of
	  fishbone skin to bottom and now display unscaled.
			<li>Fix for bug <a href="http://bugs.slimdevices.com/show_bug.cgi?id=366">366</a>. Directories that consist
	  of just spaces do not cause the scan algorithm to fall into
	  an infinite loop.
			<li>Fix for bug <a href="http://bugs.slimdevices.com/show_bug.cgi?id=640">640</a> - We could get into
          situations where going left from the home menu would crash
          the server.
			<li>fixed an infinite loop in INPUT.List for
	  empty lists.
			<li>fix a bug where volume bar is rendered
	  incorrectly when activated from another INPUT.Bar mode
			<li>fix a bug in fishbone skin that made all
	  searches into search for artist
			<li>Added postulated fix for WMA files that
	  have broken headers with block lengths that are shorter than
	  possible.
			<li>Fixed a problem where the spinning cursor
	  animation while blocked on long operations (like entering a
	  LARGE directory) was broken.
			<li>fix bug <a href="http://bugs.slimdevices.com/show_bug.cgi?id=626">626</a> - add persistence for search
	  choice in Fishbone skin.  fix cookies and page loading so
	  that forms are reset properly on submit
			<li>Fix logic in how we trigger rescans...
	  Rescanning should happen at the right time now.
			<li>Fix pulldown menus in
	  Fishbone skin for Safari.
			<li>Move history load at startup to happen, so
	  plugins that install protocol handlers do it sooner, before
	  we start dealing with non-standard URLs.
			<li>Fixed a problem where sometimes iTunes and
	  Moodlogic background checking might not start automatically.
	  At startup, now always start checking the libraries.
	  Remember the last import time across server restarts.
			<li>When adding a playlist to a current
	      shuffled playlist, make sure we keep the curent song
	      when playing or paused
			<li>Fix bug <a href="http://bugs.slimdevices.com/show_bug.cgi?id=561">561</a> fix mute handling so that
	      players no longer unpause to muted
			<li>Fix a problem where the slimproto port
	  was not bound to the specified interface when starting with
	  command line options.
			<li>Windows installer fixes: it doesn't need
	  stuff from other platforms. When installing a nightly, make
	  sure we update the slimserver.exe file, even if it doesn't
	  have a new verison number.
			<li>bug <a href="http://bugs.slimdevices.com/show_bug.cgi?id=592">592</a> and <a href="http://bugs.slimdevices.com/show_bug.cgi?id=450">450</a>: APEtags were being
	  ignored in MPC files.  excessive sanity checks caused the
	  tags not to be read convert keys to all caps for better
	  matching with slimserver fix TRACK tag mapping in
	  Formats::Musepack to get the correct track number.
			<li>Bug <a href="http://bugs.slimdevices.com/show_bug.cgi?id=588">588</a>: M3U and PLS files that SlimServer
	  writes should use file paths, not file: URLs.</li>
			<li>bug <a href="http://bugs.slimdevices.com/show_bug.cgi?id=593">593</a>: fix a bug where fishbone undock
	  link only opened first player now opens a window for the
	  current player, each player can have its own undocked
	  window</li>

		<ul>
		<li>Tweak brightness levels.  Add basic font documentation.</li>
		<li>Update CPAN LWP package.
		<li>Accepted patch for simplifying the squeezebox.version file format.</li>
		<li>Adding a default package base for template toolkit plugins - "Plugins::TT" Place any Template Toolkit plugins in the &lt;slimserver&gt;/Plugins/TT directory.</li> Package Namespace is HTML::&lt;skinname&gt;::&lt;PackageName&gt;.</li>
		<li>Also allow Template Toolkit plugins in the Skin Directories.
		<li>Cleaned up internal handling of volume, treble, bass and pitch.  They are now client methods rather than a mix of client methods, client prefs and module functions.
		<li>Add comment stating that filltemplate() is obsolete.</li>
		<li>Add stringHeader param option for INPUT.Text</li>
		<li>Remove a bogus assert() from Select.pm</li>
		<li>Moved client default settings to the client objects for initialization, as some of them are client type specific, especially the font stuff.</li>
		<li>Created the notion of protocol handlers in Source.pm. These are classes that can be registered to handle specific URL schemes for remote streams. Changed most of the isHTTPURL checks to isRemoteURL. In the long run, the different codepaths for local vs. remote shouldn't exist. There should be handler for file: URLs and more should be pushed into the handler. Moved http: and icy: protocols, including shoutcast metadata handling into a separate registered handler class. Wrote a RadioIO plugin that adds a handler.</li>
		<li>Added --diag option which gives verbose diagnostic information (use diagnostics;) use sparingly, as it DRAMATICALLY slows down regular expression parsing.</li>

		<li>Fixed problems with missed or duplicate button presses
		<li>Notify the server more quickly when buffer is full. Synced players should start up faster.
		<li>Vastly improves UI snappiness. Simplified player protocol to reduce chattiness.  Removed many redundant status messages.

<h2><a name="v5.2.1" id="v5.2.1"></a>Version 5.2.1 - 2004-07-03</h2>
<ul>
	<li>SlimServer Bug Fixes
		<ul>
			<li>Fix Bug <a href="http://bugs.slimdevices.com/show_bug.cgi?id=424">424</a>: Songinfo download link crashes server when no client found.
			<li>Fix Bug <a href="http://bugs.slimdevices.com/show_bug.cgi?id=423">423</a> where a bad function call would crash the server after selecting a mood.
			<li>Fix a problem where a truncated MP3 file could cause the server to lock up and each a lot of CPU power.
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Documentation
		<ul>
			<li>Updated FAQ in online documentation.
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Squeezebox Firmware Version 29
		<ul>
			<li>Fixed a problem where Squeezebox would not unpause properly if paused for a long time on some systems.
			<li>Fixed a problem on some players where Squeezebox would reboot if there was some spurious infrared activity.
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="v5.2.0" id="v5.2.0"></a>Version 5.2.0 - 2004-06-25</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Streaming to MP3 Players
		<ul>
			<li>Added bitrate limiting - the ability to set a maximum bitrate to be streamed to a device. Based on the bitrate, we may transcode to a low(er) bitrate MP3 than the original source, if LAME is installed.
			<li>Preference page in Server Settings to control and view maximum bitrate and conversion settings for music formats.
			<li>Wired Squeezebox have no bandwidth limit, wireless ones default to 320kb.
			<li>Did some work on fixing the problem of some receivers not syncing up properly at the beginning of tracks. The silence mp3 data that I had created had the wrong sample rate. Now when we scan through a file or try to jump to the middle, try to line up on MP3 frame boundries. This should keep the S/PDIF receivers from dropping out.
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Files and formats
		<ul>
			<li>Improved performance with scanning the music folder.
			<li>Richard Purdie added a TTL (Time to Live) field. This is used to see when the file was last checked for changes.
			<li>Add data sources (Moodlogic, iTunes, MusicFolder) can be used at the same time.
			<li>Fix several song count errors. All these changes should leave the song counters much more robust.
			<li>Fixed a problem where tags scanned from AAC files ripped with iTunes didn't convert UTF8 encoded tag information into Latin1.
			<li>Fixed bug where wmadec output needed to be byte swapped by lame.
			<li>Fixed problem decoding Apple Lossless encoded files.
		</ul>
	</li>

	<li>Firmware: A fairly big firmware upgrade (now v.27) that should make network performance (especially uncompressed streaming over wireless) a lot better.
		<ul>
			<li>TCP changes: - enable keep alive transmissions every 60 seconds when idle. This keeps the data stream open while playback is paused (zero rx window).
			<li>Tweaking memory timing fixed the problem where some players would not take a firmware update if the wireless card was installed. May fix other bugs that seem to be player-specific, eg audio glitches, TCP timeouts.
			<li>Fixed crash when attempting to locate the server again if it disappears.
			<li>Changed "re-discovery" mechanism so it continues trying to contact the "last known" IP on port 3483 while also attempting discovery in case the server has moved.
			<li>Changed timeout on control connection to 20s instead of 10s to prevent needless re-connections if the server blocks for a little while.
			<li>Fixed possible channel swap in PCM mode.
			<li>Fix incorrect buffer emptiness calculation that was causing it to play an extra little clip when the buffer plays our or underruns.
			<li>Fix sporadic swapping of channels when unpausing in PCM mode. Caused by incorrect syncrhonization of the data stream with respect to the output frame clock.
			<li>Fix click when going between PCM tracks, caused by sometimes sending all-ones instead of all zeroes.

		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Installation
		<ul>
			<li>On Windows, slimsvc.exe and slim.exe have been replaced with a asingle executable, slim.exe which can run as a windows service or "interactively".
			<li>Several updates and improvements to Windows installation should make it a lot smoother when you're upgrading.
			<li>Fix for windows installer that correctly uninstalls the old service even if we're installing into a new location.
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Plugins
		<ul>
			<li>Several fixes to the SHOUTcast plugin, including some crashing bugs and improvements: you can now customize the Genres you see, it works correctly with mutiple clients. 
			<li>Plugins can now expose their own web interface. Don't be surprised if you see new home page links when you install plugins.
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Web Interface
		<ul>
			<li>Peter Speck's alphabet patch: Miscellaneous special character improvements.
			<li>Kevin Pearsall noticed that web browsers were caching pages too agressively even after we change skins. Now when we first load an item into the html cache, we return a modification time of time() to force expiration of client caches after reload.
			<li>Decide on whether or not to show the Music Folder on the Squeezebox Home screen based on whether we have one defined. 
			<li>Show Saved Playlists directory if the user has a playlist directory defined or they are using itunes or moodlogic.
			<li>Bug <a href="http://bugs.slimdevices.com/show_bug.cgi?id=313">313</a> - Wireless signal strength is now shown at the bottom of the player settings page along with MAC, IP, firmware.
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>3rd party software integration:
		<ul>
			<li>SoftSqueeze is now included in the release and better supported by SlimServer thanks to Richard Titmuss.	You can launch it via Java Webstart with the URL: <a href="http://localhost:9000/EN/html/softsqueeze/webstart.html">http://localhost:9000/EN/html/softsqueeze/webstart.html</a> or view it as an applet with this URL: <a href="http://localhost:9000/EN/html/softsqueeze/applet.html">http://localhost:9000/EN/html/softsqueeze/applet.html</a>.
			<li>Richard Titmuss fixed a problem where SoftSqueeze wasn't being sync'ed properly with real hardware players.
			<li>Moodlogic and and iTunes now have their own settings pages if they are installed.
			<li>KDF made extensive improvements to MoodLogic integration, including exporting user and auto playlists, more control over remixing, support for multiple file types in playlists, rescan interval setting.
			<li>Improved iTunes interaction: unchecked iTunes tracks are not ignored, better autolocation of the iTunes library, 
			<li>Apple broke the importing of protected AAC files, so we disable that file type. :-(
			<li>Fix Bug <a href="http://bugs.slimdevices.com/show_bug.cgi?id=299">299</a>, allowing rescan button to work even for moodlogic, itunes.
			<li>Slimserver will no longer issue a message if audiodir is blank, so long as either moodlogic or itunes import are in use.
			<li>John Bent sent a patch for xPL: The patch prevents xPL instances from appearing on the network with spaces in them.
			<li>Change Zeroconf/Rendezvous names to be legal for HTTP and CLI interfaces, now: _slimhttp._tcp and _slimcli._tcp as well as the existing _http._tcp

<h2><a name="v5.1.3" id="v5.1.3"></a>Version 5.1.3 - 2004-4-16</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Plugins
		<ul>
			<li>The SHOUTcast brower plugin, originally written by Peter Heslin is included in the standard release.</li>
			<li>We added a few more modules from CPAN, including libwww, File::Temp and Compress:Zlib to our release, which should make it easier for folks to write plugins</li>
			<li>Plugins can now be configured to reside at the Home menu level if desired.  Default to doing so with the SHOUTcast pluging for new users.
		</ul>
	</li>

	<li>Localization & Internationalization
		<ul>
			<li>Added contributed patch by Peter Speck for some Danish characters.
			<li>Peter Nou updated the Swedish translations.  Thanks, Peter!</li>
			<li>Frederic Miserey updated the french localized images, fixed a bug in the remote documentation.

		</ul>
	</li>

	<li>Player Interface
		<ul>
			<li>Accepted patch that reduce custom character flicker from Phil Barrett
			<li>Fixed a problem where the bitrate displayed for some songs was not rounded properly.
			<li>screensaver was not jumping to proper screensaver while playing.  Only ongoing animation, power off, and blocking should stop screensaver.
			<li>screensaver was not jumping to proper screensaver while playing.  Only ongoing animation, power off, and blocking should stop screensaver.
			<li>Fixed several problems with FFWD and REW trick modes.  Seems better about jumping to random locations, but occasionally still won't go back to 1x when we're towards the end of a song.  
			<li>Fixed a problem where players wer resyncing after restart even if master was powered off.  Check the power state for masters as well, and only resync if they are on. For temporary unsync, save settings before issuing the stop command.
			<li>Can now add by artist name again.
			<li>Fix a problem with a deadlock that could cause buffer underruns or stalls with short songs to not get played if the server hits the end of the song while waiting to fill the buffer.			
			<li>fix lists and sorting created by 'ALL_ALBUMS' and/or 'ALL_SONGS' while browsing using the remote.
		</ul>
	</li>

			<li>Peter Timofejew submitted a patch to not import songs marked as disabled in iTunes.
			<li>Peter Timofejew submitted a patch to fix a problem with automount paths in iTunes XML files.
		</ul>
	</li>
	
	<li>File Formats
		<ul>
			<li>Contributed patch by Guy Albertelli to handle multiple artist and genre names in ID3 tags.
			<li>Accept John Harding's patch to WMA.pm to fix parsing of Track numbers (and probably more).  Dan, please review.
			<li>Updated patch for AIFF files and AIFC files from Caleb Epstein.  We now can extract metadata and play many more AIFF and AIFC files.
			<li>Rob Funk submitted a patch that ignores punctuation for the purposes of sorting.
			<li>Extract more ID3 tag information from QuickTime movies and AAC files, especially those ripped with iTunes.
			<li>Fixed a problem for files that have [ and ] chars in filename
			<li>Split multi-value ID3 tags by / as well as the ; and \0 we had before
			<li>Add multiple tag support for Composer and Band			
			<li>Frederic Miserey noticed that we weren't extracting the number of discs in a set from Movie/AAC metadata.  Fixed.
			<li>Accepted Peter Speck's patch for fixing the bug in that failed to detect missing binaries used in transcoding. Also, Peter patched up some problems in the AIFF parser:
				<ul>
					<li>The sample rate is an 'extended', which is 10 bytes. Only first 6 bytes was read, so $encoding was always garbage.
					<li>Chunks are always an even number of bytes, even if the chunkSize entry is odd (it is null-byte padded).  All my AIFF files have an even chunk size for all chunks except the last chunk, which is an ID3 entry lacking the null-padding. So it have not been a problem for me, just noticed it...
					<li>Removed the redundant tell($f) statements and made the chunk-seeking logic a simple while() loop, which makes the diff big.
					<li>I have renamed chunkoffset to dataoffset, as it is the offset of the sound data, and not the offset of the chunk.
				</ul>
			<li>Updated the convert.conf file so that when LAME is invoked to encode into MP3, we force to resample at a 44.1k sample rate.  Some non-standard sample rates were causing LAME to fail.
			<li>Kevin Pearsall found that convert.conf file had some extraneous "1" options in the oggdec entries, which breaks under the latest oggdec.
			<li>Reformatted types.conf to remove tabs to make it easier for folks to edit.
			<li>Applied patch for FLAC cue files to play to the end.
			<li>We now check to see if the appropriate binaries are available and skip any configurations that require specific binaries.  The syntax of the convert.conf file has been changed slightly, now binaries are expressed as [binaryname] instead of $binaryname$
			<li>Older config files that use the $binaryname$ format should still work, but won't get run-time checks for the presence of the binaries.
			<li>Squeezebox also "prefers" MP3 conversion when possible on wireless, uncompress when wired.  Use the File Formats page in Additional Server Settings to override this behavior.  All of this is to make life easier for new customers who are trying to get AAC and other non-MP3 formats working with the least amount of messing. Out of the box, the behavior is similar as it was, but if you install LAME, it will try to use it unless you disable that line in the configuration.
			<li>Jason Holtzapple submitted a patch that makes cue sheets for FLAC work.  Requires the very latest FLAC to work. 
			<li>Accepted patch from Henry Mason that uses MovieExport data procs in mov123.  This supports more file types under QuickTime.
			<li>More sanity checking in the WAV package to handle some malformed WAV files.
			<li>Fixed a problem where we sometimes weren't switching between PCM and MP3 modes between different file types.
			<li>Track current directory and artwork during scan. Don't search if we already know the cover and thumb in that dir.
			<li>Robert Moser noted that we don't need to uppercase everything twice.
			<li>Victor Brilon submitted a patch for a more thorough list of artwork filenames
		</ul>
	</li>
	

	
	<li>Web Interface
		<ul>
			<li>The built-in webserver is now HTTP 1.1 compliant, thanks to Dan Sully, so page reloads should be much quicker and overall performance improved
			<li>Stefan Christiansson updated the Touch skin to include settings and an about page.
			<li>Cover artwork images now search large-to-small for cover and small-to-large for thumb sizes.
			<li>We've updated our HTML skins system to use the excellent Template Toolkit. Visit http://www.template-toolkit.org for documentation on Template Toolkit.  <li>Script for converting homebrew templates to Template Toolkit compatible ones.	
			<li>There was a conflict between the parameter used to declare a page title and the parameter used to declare a song title. Changed the page title to "pagetitle" from just "title".
			<li>KDF suggested a patch that fixes errant arrows in the search pages.
			<li>Check to make sure Cache directory is writable or creatable.  If not, just cache in RAM.
			<li>Override uri filter when creating new template objects rather than universally.
			<li>Fixed a problem where all_subfolders link was accidentally included when browsing playlists too
			<li>The ability to create variable artwork filenames is in there, but for full compatibility, there needs to be an option to store them all in a central location. This is now added.  Windows and Linux, by default use $bin/Artwork, while OSX will use $ENV{'HOME'}/Music/Artwork
			<li>Make use of title tag on images in default skin, since we're working on it.		
			<li>Eliminated mysterious extra &lt;html&gt;...&lt;/html&gt; from status.html
			<li>Took out the dead playlist add/play links for Music Folder top level.
			<li>Added a whitespace in songinfo to keep give the location url a bit of room.
			<li>Status and Status Header don't need to show the mute button for non-players, since there is no volume control.
			<li>Clean up some overlapping elements in Player Settings
			<li>Group sync settings to help avoid overlapping again.
			<li>Bring Titleformats back for http players, stream title will show standardTitle so its nice to be able to configure it.
			<li>Fix a missing image in the upgrade page for the Default skin.
			<li>Clarify the upgrade explanation in case of failure.
			<li>Also, reordered the repeat buttons on the default skin to make more sense.  (Another from Fred)
			<li>Dean suggested changes to the scrollrate and scrollpause descriptions.
			<li>changed the setup values to allow zero scrollpause, since it should be working now. 
			<li>duration and durationseconds got mixed together at some point.  This broke the progressbar in Touch and Fishbone. durationseconds is now the duration in seconds, while duration is the song duration in minutes and seconds.
			<li>Added settings page for enabling/disabling convert.conf entries.  Useful if you want to force LAME transcoding if you have a slower network.
			<li>Another patch from Frederic for power status in the Default skin.
			<li>Fixed a problem where the song duration wasn't passed correctly to the XML skin.
			<li>use proper countdown number for sleep time in status
			<li>cleanup songinfo to fit comments in readable space
			<li>tidy up alignment of status_header code
			<li>add support for editing playlists in Fishbone, cleanup the code tabbing.
			<li>Felix Mueller submitted some improvements to his playlist editor.  I modified it a bit to make it work for all saved M3U and PLS playlists.
			<li>Throw a 404 if requested setup page doesn't exist, as in  setup.html?page=bogus
			<li>Throw a 404 if a requested skin does not exist.
			<li>Throw a 404 if no handler found in generateHTTPResponse.
			<li>Add content_type of text/html to error responses, and close socket after sending them.
			<li>constrain image sizes in main views.  default to using 100x100 and 200x200 images.
			<li>songinfo artwork is now a link to the raw full size image.
			<li>A surprising number of the HTML files had DOS line endings, which messes with cvs diff sometimes.  Reverted them to unix line endings.
			<li>{'sleeptime'} and {'sleep'} can be more useful as different values. use {'sleeptime'} for the sleep setting, and {'sleep'} for the time remaining
			<li>Disabled Animation setting because it just confuses folks, breaks stuff, and doesn't really improve things.
			<li>Make guessTags a server formatting setting, user able to add more or re-order
		</ul>
	</li>
	
	<li>Streaming to MP3 Players
		<ul>
			<li>Trying to reduce latency in the HTTP streaming.  Clearing the buffer if the song stops or changes.
		</ul>
	</li>
		
	<li>Command Line & Debugging
		<ul>
			<li>d_itunes_verbose is a valid debug flag, so it should be accepted from the command line as well.
			<li>Safety check on buffersize to prevent crashes from clients that misbehave.
			<li>Fix an errant tab in the strings.txt file that was causing a warning.
			<li>Add --d_http_verbose debugging flag.

	<li>Macintosh
		<ul>
			<li>Move tag database to ~/Library/Caches/SlimServer under Mac OSX
		</ul
	</li>
	
	<li>Windows
		<ul>
			<li>Added a couple of additional Windows registry keys in the installer to help find the Music library.
			<li>Moodlogic: Thanks to Chris at Moodlogic, we now have a bit more information on what we can make available. Now added two settings to the moodlogic server settings:
			<ul>
				<li>instantMixMax - sets the maximum songs for a playlist.
				<li>varietyCombo - from 0-100 where Lower number means a wider selection of songs and a higher number means a closer match to the song picked.
			</ul>
		
			<li>Moodlogic: Some info that the server uses was not being provided by Moodlogic (ie Bitrate), so use readTags and let moodlogic alter info as it	requires.  readTags also handles artwork, so its no longer needed in Moodlogic.pm
			<li>Adding artwork scanning for Moodlogic
			<li>We now include flac.exe and oggdec.exe for windows in the release for yummy FLAC and Ogg playback.
		</ul>
	</li>

	<li>Unix/Linux
		<ul>
			<li>Pat Farrell updated the unix Installation.txt file.
		</ul>
	</li>
	
	<li>Squeezebox Firmware - Experimental
		<ul>
			<li>Updated default Squeezebox Firmware to v.10 - no changes from version 8, except that it can be updated to versions 20 and above.
			<li>Firmware v.21 is included for testing, but is not installed by default.  To enable, edit the file Firmware/squeezebox.version and remove the # signs on the last two lines.  The following changes are for version 21:
			<li>This firmware update uses a new mechanism for downloading the firmware and storing it in flash memory. Due to the extent of these changes, this is a one-way upgrade.  - Current SlimServer version is required
			<li>TCP has been enhanced to respond better under packet loss conditions. This should dramatically reduce dropouts when streaming uncompressed audio over wireless. Also, interactive performance is improved. In particular, this should eliminate any small delays in screen updates during an animation sequence (eg push animation, slimtris).	
			<li>There is a new mechanism for transferring firmware upgrade images, which uses slimproto instead of a separate data connection. This provides for a few things, 1)  firmware updates may now be installed over NAT and through firewalls and 2) display updates and status messages can still be communicated during the update process, so we now show a nice progress bar during the download. 3) updates which are interrupted during download or during installation no longer require the failsafe update mode.  Instead, the squeezebox will boot normally using the previous image.
			<li>"Raw" infrared codes are now transmitted to the server. This means that the server will now receive ANY 39KHz infrared signals that the squeezebox receives. This feature is not currently utilized by the server, but is available for potential applications such as keyboard interfaces (webtv keyboards, for example, should work), macros, and controlling the squeezebox in response to other events (eg receiver being turned on).
			<li>Other internal changes: updated OS and drivers, new flash and sram organization, increased ethernet and TCP rx buffers, reduced CPU usage
			<li>Fix buffer overrun condition when streaming from Windows XP machines using Intel ethernet cards that use TCP segmentation offloading
			<li>JVC infrared codes now work correctly
			<li>Fix problem where firmware updates over wireless could occasionally  fail.
			<li>Fixed "Can't alloc netpages for dll" message during setup
			<li>Fix problem where WLAN scan results would disappear if the user backs up  through the setup menu after selecting a wireless network.
			<li>New firmware will report buffer size and fullness rather than read and write pointer.  Account for this in the server.
			<li>Don't complain about the server being gone except when pressing up/down/left/right/power buttons. Before, we would nag about the server on  receiving any kind of NEC-compatible IR signal.
			<li>Adding support for raw IR pass-through so that somebody can make an ssh client using a webtv keyboard.
			<li>Upcoming firmware revisions will use a new update mechanism. We're going to jump to from rev 8 to 20 for the new SDK5-based firmware and that'll be how we tell the difference for the purpose of loading a firmware image.
			<li>Instead of the server connecting to the squeezebox and uploading the image, the new mechanism will use slimproto. This means, among other things, that the control channel stays connected, and we can display a nice status screen during the update. Some changes to slimproto:
			<li>Deprecated client->server opcode: BYE!. We might use this later for  something else. In the mean time, it is still of course supported for  older firmware revs.
		</ul>
	</li>
				
	<li>Lots of bugs listed in the <a href="http://bugs.slimdevices.com/">bug database</a> were fixed:
		<ul>
			<li>Bug <a href="http://bugs.slimdevices.com/show_bug.cgi?id=197">197</a> - Add 'All Subfolders' link under browse music folder.  To make it simple, its still a link, but it does nothing.  It allows access to playlist commands to add/play/remove/insert the entire library.
			<li>Bug <a href="http://bugs.slimdevices.com/show_bug.cgi?id=212">212</a> - Missing Documentation.  Adding title tags and filling out the alt tags will give the tooltips requested for the graphic buttons.
			<li>Bug <a href="http://bugs.slimdevices.com/show_bug.cgi?id=233">233</a> - I accidentally swapped scrollpause and scrollrate EN text
			<li>Bug <a href="http://bugs.slimdevices.com/show_bug.cgi?id=208">208</a> - titleformat description was out of date.  Used updated string suggested by Kevin Pearsall
			<li>Bug <a href="http://bugs.slimdevices.com/show_bug.cgi?id=41">41</a> - add 'includeArtist' and 'includeAlbum' to browse_list so that search can show more detailed info for when simpler titleformats are used. This is a dupe of the status_list feature.
			<li>Bug <a href="http://bugs.slimdevices.com/show_bug.cgi?id=219">219</a> - Phil Barrett suggested a patch  to make the # sign more attractive when in double size.
			<li>Bug <a href="http://bugs.slimdevices.com/show_bug.cgi?id=227">227</a> - Some dirs can look too much like a URL. 
			<li>Bug <a href="http://bugs.slimdevices.com/show_bug.cgi?id=97">97</a> - player specific option for transcoding bitrate, validates mp3 bitrates only.
			<li>Bug <a href="http://bugs.slimdevices.com/show_bug.cgi?id=27">27</a> - make the transcoding to HTTP streams able to be specified in the URL: http://slimserver:9000/stream.mp3?bitrate=128
			<li>Bug <a href="http://bugs.slimdevices.com/show_bug.cgi?id=33">33</a> - smart bandwidth limitation, transcode only when necessary
			<li>Bug <a href="http://bugs.slimdevices.com/show_bug.cgi?id=45">45</a> - scroll rate player preference
			<li>Bug <a href="http://bugs.slimdevices.com/show_bug.cgi?id=189">189</a> - Sync lost between players when powering off one of them sync is now restored when players are powered on.  permanent unsyc now from player settings only.
			<li>Bug <a href="http://bugs.slimdevices.com/show_bug.cgi?id=37">37</a> - sync POWER commands.  There's a new player option to sync power settings.  Players will power off and on as a group.  changing this setting will affect all players in the group.  Turning this off, will unsync all players that are currently powered off, though they will resync as they are powered back on.
			<li>Bug <a href="http://bugs.slimdevices.com/show_bug.cgi?id=185">185</a> - Set Last-Modified header, honor If-Modified-Since, etc.
			<li>Bug <a href="http://bugs.slimdevices.com/show_bug.cgi?id=221">221</a> - Fixed a problem where HTTP clients had some inappropriate player settings in the web interface.
			<li>Bug <a href="http://bugs.slimdevices.com/show_bug.cgi?id=46">46</a> - the location URL on the song info page should be a full URL This seemed to need to be case insensitive so that windows users who type in an audiodir in lower case, will still match with the songpath, which has uppercase drive letters
			<li>Bug <a href="http://bugs.slimdevices.com/show_bug.cgi?id=122">122</a> - allow the user to control the timeout when connecting to remote sites.
			<li>Bug <a href="http://bugs.slimdevices.com/show_bug.cgi?id=213">213</a> - repeating playlist when synched checksync wasn't paying attention to the playmode, so when players were ready, it would skip head.  Now it checks for playmode-stop and will stop the playback.  playmode-play will allow the playback to continue for the next song, or the repeat loopback.
		</ul>
	</li>
		
	<li>Experimental
		<ul>
			<li>Added support for a "silent" setting that should allow slave players that don't actually have audio streamed to them.  This has not been thoroughly tested.
			<li>Added a prototype pitch control.  It only works on Squeezebox now and only with MP3 files, and only after a song is restarted.  But it's a start.
		</ul>	
	</li>		
						
</ul>

<h2><a name="v5.1.1" id="v5.1.1"></a>Version 5.1.1 - 2004-3-3</h2>

	<li>Remove a number of annoying, but harmless warning messages.
	
	<li>Fixed bug in mov123 caused AAC audio on Windows to come out in little endian format, causing lots of noise.
	
	<li>There was a sanity check in AIFF file scanning to make sure that the top level chunk size header was 
	smaller than the file size.  Unfortunately, iTunes for Windows creates AIFF files that are 
	insane.
	
	<li>Bumping copyright to 2004
	
	<li>Fixed a bug that would cause AAC files to appear twice when using iTunes and cover art scanning.
	
	<li>Fixed a problem where items in playlists would appear as MP3 even if they weren't.

	<li>Michael Herger updated the German translations.
	
	<li>Skins have access to the full query parameters, as well as the the magnitude of the currently playing rate.
	
	<li>It turns out that iTunes, when ripping AIFF files tosses ID3 tags in there. Now we know how to look for them.
	
	<li>Performance improvements to scanning cover art when using iTunes.
	
	<li>Stefan Christiansson created the Touch skin, appropriate for large touch-screen displays.
	
	<li>Add the sleep info to the skins, including the XML skin.
	
	<li>Make sure we reset the pause time when appropriate.  Should fix one problem with bogus progress times on radio stations.

	<li>Vidur Apparao needed an init and shutdown function for his upcoming plugin, so we'll add these. 
	Vidur added another neat feature for plugins.  You can create a packaged plugin with lots of dependent
	files by putting it in a folder in the plugins folder.  It simply loads the file Plugin.pm in that folder.
	
	
	<li>Up the remote stream timeout.  Should make some streams more reliable.
	
	<li>Use hard spaces in double height characters to fix centering problems.
	
	<li>Nicolas Guillemain updated the french translation.
	
	<li>Fix crash if Radio Station.pls doesn't exist.
	
	<li>There's no reason (that I can think of) to not accept commands on a stream.mp3 URL.

	is very useful.
	
	<li>Patch from KDF to make sure we only worry about images that have coverart when doing the iTunes coverart scan.
	
	<li>Remove duplicate call to Command::execute for streaming connections.
	
	<li>Fix a problem transcoding AAC to MP3 on Windows machines.  Props to Kevin Pearsall for regressing...

	<li>AAC transcoding works on Windows, not just Macs.
	<li>Dave Nanian updated the Mac installer and preference pane to be ready for SlimServer.  It was a lot of work, mostly because Dean was breaking things.</li>
	<li>Mac specific code is now built in XCode and is Panther friendly.
	<li>SLIMP3 Firmware Updater is a separate Mac application now, rather than built in to the preference pane.
	<li>Rod Nayfield submitted a patch to handle automounts in iTunes under Panther better.
	<li>Added support for icy: URLs which are what NiceCast uses.
	<li>Robert Moser made the button framework much more flexible, with wildcards, etc...
	<li>Fixed a problem in settings in some languages where the iTunes choice was a bit scrambled
	<li>Fixed the windows installer/uninstaller to uninstall SLIMP3 Server when installing SlimServer.  When uninstalling SlimServer (why would you ever do that?), it cleans up more better.
