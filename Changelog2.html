	<h2>Version 2.3 Release 05/19/02</h2>
</a>
<ul>
	<li>Multiple players can now synchronize their audio outputs to within 1 millisecond of each other. This allows you to play the same music in more than one room, without any &quot;reverb&quot; effect. If the server knows about more than one client, there is a Sync hronization choice in SLIMP3 Home. Press RIGHT to enter that area. Scroll through the other players and press RIGHT to sync up. Press right again to unsync.
	<li>Dean has created a new MacOSX tool for starting and stopping the SLIMP3 server. We are now distributing a MacOSX version of the server in .dmg format. Just drag the icon to your hard disk to install. You can also put it in the dock. The server keeps running after you log out.
