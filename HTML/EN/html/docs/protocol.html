<h4>Overview</h4>

<p>This documents the SLIMP3 protocol, as implemented in Squeezebox Server 5.0.1 and SLIMP3 v2.2 firmware.  The
protocol is UDP based.
The SLIMP3 communicates using a custom UDP-based protocol. This protocol
is designed to be extremely light-weight. It gives the server low-level
access to the hardware and full control over the user interface, so as to
mimize the amount of hardware and software required on the client side.
</p>

<p>
All packets are preceded by an 18-byte header. The first byte in this header
is a token which indicates the format of the rest of the header. Some kinds of
packets may have also have variable amounts of data after the header. Variable
length data is not delimited - the length is taken from the UDP header. All
numbers are unsigned integers, in network order. The server listens on port
1069, and replies to the source port of the packets it receives from the
client.  The server identifies individual clients by MAC address.  The last 6
bytes of any Client -> Server message are the client's MAC address.

<h4>Server -> Client</h4>
<p> </p>

<p>
<b>'D' - Discovery response</b>
</p>
<blockquote>

<pre>
Field   Value/Description 
0       'D' as in "discovery" 
1       reserved 
2..5    server's IP address, or 0.0.0.0 
6..7    server's port 
8..17   reserved
</pre>

<p>
On receiving a (d)iscovery request broadcast (see below) from a supported
client, the server replies with a unicast (D)iscovery response, containing the
IP and port number that the client should contact. If the server's IP address
is left blank (0.0.0.0), then the client will instead get the IP address and
port from the IP/UDP packet headers. A server replying to a discovery request
may redirect a client to another server (for load balancing) using this
mechanism. If multiple discovery responses are received, the client will
select the first one it receives.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
<b>'h' - Say hello</b>
</p>

<blockquote>

<pre>
Field   Value/Description 
0       'h' as in "hello" 
1..17   reserved
</pre>

<p>
This is used by the server to determine if previous known clients are up, and
to obtain the model and firmware revision of those clients. Clients reply with
another (h)ello, see below.
</p>

<p>
<b>'l' - Send data to the lcd/vfd display
</b>
</p>
<blockquote>

<pre>
Field   Value/Description 
0       'l' as in "lcd" 
1..17   reserved (ignored) 
18...   variable length string of 16-bit codes
</pre>

<p>
The Noritake vacuum fluorescent display used in the SLIMP3 implements the
standard Hitachi LCD interface, plus additional codes for controlling
brightness. The data sheet is in CVS under docs/datasheets. The SLIMP3 protocol
allows both "character data" and "commands" to be sent directly to the display.
It also allows you to insert a delay between characters. This is used to insert
the required delay after the "clear screen" command, and can also be used to
create animated sequences. The delay feature is not currently used by the
server, and probably shouldn't be used in its current implementation, because
the player has to spin for the specified time and can not be interrupted.
Instead, delays should be implemented in an interruptible manner on the server
side.
</p>

<p>
The 16-bit codes are:
</p>

<pre>
00XX, where XX specifies a delay in ms, up to 255
02XX, where XX is a command
03XX, where XX is one of the 256 characters supported by the display
</pre>

<p>
<b>'m' - write MPEG data into the player's buffer</b>
</p>

<blockquote>

<pre>
Field   Value/Description 
0       'm' as in "mpeg" 
1       control signal
2..5    reserved (used in earlier protocols)
6..7    write pointer
8..9    reserved
10..11  sequence number
12..17  reserved 
18..    variable length string of data (length must be even # of bytes)
</pre>


<p>
This message feeds data into the client's buffer, and also controls whether
the decoder is running.  The control signal indicates what the decoder should
be doing:
</p>

<pre>
        0       decoding
        1       stopped (but do not reset buffer)
        3       stopped, reset read pointer to 0
</pre>

<p>The write pointer gives the address in the buffer to which the data should be
written.  The sequence number is an identifier for the packet.  The client must
acknowledge each MPEG data packet received with an "ack" message.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
<b>'2' - read/write the i2c bus</b>
</p>

<blockquote>

<pre>
Field    Value/Description
0        '2' as in "i2c"
1..17    reserved
18..     string of i2c commands and data  
</pre>

<p>
The protocol allows the i2c bus to be manipulated down to the level of
discrete start / stop / ack / nack / read / write operations. The data
sent after the header is a string of these operations, specified as
follows:
</p>

<pre>
wX   write the byte X onto the bus
r    read a byte from the bus
s    start
p    stop
a    ack
n    nack
</pre>

<p>
The client acknowledges all i2c packets. See '2' under the
&quot;Client-&gt;Server&quot; section.<p>
</p>

<p>
Please see the <a  
href="http://www-us.semiconductors.philips.com/i2c/facts/"> Philips web
site</a> for more information on i2c. At the bottom of that page, you'll
find
the i2c spec sheet in PDF format.

<h4>Client -> Server</h4>

<p>
<b>'d' - Discovery request</b>
</p>

<blockquote>

<pre>
Field   Value/Description 
0       'd' as in "discovery" 
1       reserved
2       Device ID, '1' for SLIMP3 
3       Firmware rev, eg 0x11 for version 1.1 
4..11   reserved
12..17  MAC address
</pre>

<p>
This packet is sent to the broadcast address on port 1069. The client sends
this during startup to discover the server's IP address, after the client has
configured his own IP interface. The server replies with a unicast 'D' packet -
see above.  Firmware v2.2 identifies itself as 1.1.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
<b>'h' - Say hello</b>
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
Field   Value/Description 
0       'h' as in "hello" 
1       Device ID, '1' for SLIMP3 
2       Firmware rev, eg 0x11 for version 1.1 
3..11   reserved
12..17  MAC address
</pre>

<p>
The SLIMP3 sends a hello packet to the server when it first starts up, and
whenever it receives a hello from the server. This is for the server to learn
that a new client is ready, or for the server to query a client to see if
here's still there.
</p>
<p>
NB whilst this may be what the client sends, the server is only interested in
the MAC address, and ignores thee device id and firmware completely.
</p>

<p>
<b>'i' - IR code</b>
</p>

<blockquote>

<pre>
Field   Value/Description 
0       'i' as in "IR" 
1       0x00 
2..5    player's time since startup in ticks @625 KHz 
6       0xFF (will eventually be an identifier for different IR code sets) 
7       number of meaningful bits - always 16 (0x10) for JVC 
8..11   the 32-bit IR code 
12..17  MAC address
</pre>

<b>'2' - i2c response</b>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<pre>
Field    Value/Description
0        '2' as in "i2c"
1..17    reserved
18...    string of bytes in response to the requested i2c 
         read operations, if any
</pre>
</p>

0        'a' as in ack
1..5     reserved
6..7     write pointer
8..9     read pointer
10..11   sequence number
12..17   MAC address
</pre>
</blockquote>


<p>
This packet is sent in response to an mpeg data packet.  Write pointer is
ignored by the server (this makes sense, because the client no longer
maintains the write pointer).  The read pointer is the position in the buffer
that the decoder is reading from.  The sequence number is the sequence number
from the packet being acknowledged.
</p>

<h4>Streaming and Buffering</h4>
<p> </p>

<p>
The SLIMP3's buffer chip is a 128K x 8 (1Mbit) SRAM. It is presented to the
server as a 64K x 16 circular buffer.  The server sends packets to the client,
with the address in the buffer where they are to be stored, and with a
sequence identifier.  The client acks each packet as it receives it.  The
server ensures that each packet has been acknowledged by the client, and will
resend any packets that are not acknowledged promptly.  Once the server has
filled the client's buffer it will send zero length data packets, and will
monitor the read pointer returned in the client's acknowledgement, sending
further packets as necessary to keep the buffer full.
</p>

<p>
The read pointer is maintained by the client, and is the position from which
the decoder is currently reading.  The server can order this read pointer to
be reset to the beginning of the buffer by sending a control code of "3" to
the client in a data packet.  These control codes also control whether the
decoder is running or not (see 'm' write MPEG data).
</p>

<p>
At the start of each track, the server will send a number of packets with the
control set to "3", in order to allow the client to build up a small buffer
before starting decoding.  The control with then switch to "0".  "1" is used
to pause the player.
</p>

<p>
The SLIMP3's buffer chip is a 128K x 8 (1Mbit) SRAM.  It is presented to the server as a 64K
x 16 circular buffer.  The SLIMP3 maintains two pointers, called rptr and wptr, which track
the position at which the DMA controller is reading (out to the decoder) and writing (in
from the network).  When a new stream is started, the SLIMP3 begins by initializing an empty
buffer, with rptr == wptr == 0. It then begins requesting data from the server, starting
from 0. The server replies with some data, which the SLIMP3 writes into the buffer. Once the
buffer reaches 50% capacity, the decoder is started, and the rptr begins to increment. The
SLIMP3 continues requesting data until the buffer is 90% full. Oncee the buffer reaches this
"almost full" state, the SLIMP3 continually checks buffer usage, requesting more data
only when the buffer usage drops below the "almost full" level. 
</p>

<p>
Timeouts due to a lost packet are handled by the client. It the SLIMP3 does not receive a
response from the server after 100ms, then it sends the request again.
</p>

<p> </p><hr><p> </p>

<h4>Other protocols supported by the player</h4>
<p>

<p>
<b>ICMP</b>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
ICMP echo (ping): The SLIMP3 will send an ICMP response and display a
message indicating where the ping came from. 
</p>

<p>
ICMP unreachable: This indicates that the server machine is up, but the server process
is not running. The SLIMP3 will display a message to the effect of "10.0.0.1: service
unreachable - are you sure the SLIMP3 server is running?"<p>
</p>

<p>
Other ICMP messages are displayed on the screen in a similar manner, but they are otherwise
ignored (eg ICMP redirect does nothing, but the player will still tell you, so you know to
fix your gateway setting).
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>UDP echo</b>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The player will echo any packet sent to it on UDP port 7. This could be used to obtain an
RTT estimate. Unlike ping, it does not cause anything to be displayed on the screen.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>DHCP</b>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
As of firmware version 1.1, the SLIMP3 can use DHCP to discover its own IP address.
</p>
