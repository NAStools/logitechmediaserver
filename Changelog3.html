			<li>Windows
			<ul>
				<li>The SLIMP3 software is now distributed with a Windows-friendly installer thanks to help from Chris Eastwood.
				<li>Fixed some bugs in the SLIMP3 Server application when it connects to a windows service. It now won't try to shut down the service when it quits.
				<li>The Moodlogic support doesn't work with the server when it's run as a Windows service. Moodlogic disabled at service startup. This will be addressed, but in the mean time, use the SLIMP3 Server application to start the server.

			</ul>
			<li>Windows
			<ul>
				<li>Moodlogic added support for their product. Download and install Moodlogic version 2.5 or later and start the SLIMP3 server software. Make sure that Moodlogic is chosen from the Server Settings page and you should be able to browse through your MoodLogic music library, create instant playlists and use the MoodLogic &quot;mood&quot; features. Neat!
			</ul>
			<li>Player Interface:
			<ul>
				<li>The current playlist is preserved across server restarts.
				<li>Fixed a bug where if you pressed the Search button on the remote when in double height mode, it wouldn't update.<br>
				<li>The text on the display didn't show the playlist length when paused, like it does when playing or stopped.
				<li>Reworked the custom character code and the VFD output code. Now you can mix and match custom characters in a given string, setting up their bitmaps only once ever.
				<li>Added support for a new VFD module that has slightly different brightness controls. We'll detect the type of display based on the MAC address.
				<li>Cleaning up the discovery protocol and client creation. There were some cases where players would get stalled and the time would never increase above zero.
				<li>Bump right animation now works in double-height mode.
				<li>Now ignoring duplicate IR packets.
			</ul>
			<li>Web Interface
			<ul>
				<li>The SLIMP3 web interface has a new look, designed by Igor Gasowski, coded by Nick Balestra and Dean Blackketter. The old interface is still available as &quot;SLIMP3 Light&quot; from the Additional Server Settings area.

				<li>index.html and home.html both include the same param information so that we can build frameless skins.
				<li>We now don't send &quot;expires: 0&quot; headers with images.
				<li>Upped the maximum number of tcp connections and connections to scan each time through the main loop. Needed to support the new skin, which is substantially more complicated.

			</ul>
			<li>Automation
			<ul>
				<li>Added support for command-line command: &quot;listen 1&quot; which allows CLI clients to watch the SLIMP3 server events. This includes &quot;raw&quot; infrared codes in this feedback.
				<li>Added support for XML files in the web interface and a future XML skin. You can add .xml files to the html directory and they will be processed using the template mechanism. If you want to create XML for use in the dynamically created pages, replace the .html files with XML equivalents (but retain the .html suffix in the files). Then refer to the files from the HTTP interface with .xml suffixes to ensure that they come back with the right content type.
				<li>Added playerpref commandline/http command to set player preferences.
			</ul>
			<li>Linux/Solaris/Unix:
			<ul>
				<li>Non-mac users can save their &quot;iTunes Music Library.xml&quot; file in their home directory on Unix machines or in the server directory on windows. Make sure the file paths are right, though.
				<li>Patch to add command line option to set user and group if launching as root.
				<li>You can now specify a logfile for error and debugging logging. Mac OS X has this go to /tmp/slimp3.log by default.

			</ul>
			<li>Mac OS X:
			<ul>
				<li>Fixed a problem on Mac OS 10.1 where the preference pane wouldn't install or stop the server properly.

		<h2><a name="v3.1b1" id="v3.1b1">Version 3.1b1, Released 2003-02-05</a></h2>
		<ul>
			<li>General
			<ul>
				<li>SliMP3 is no longer spelled SliMP3. With our new identity, it will be SLIMP3.
			</ul>
			<li>Mac OS X:
			<ul>
				<li>The server is now installed as Preference Pane, thanks to Dave Nanian, instead of an Application and now has support for automatically starting up at boot or login time.
				<li>Fixed a bug that didn't display the correct title for URLs and iTunes playlists on the top line when browsing saved playlists and the music library.
				<li>New installations will default to having the CLI turned on. Useful for things like the OSX Remote.
				<li>A German customer found that some of the content in the iTunes Music Library.xml file is localized. We were using the 'Kind' field to determine what kind of data it was. Not good. So now we look at the Mac file type long and the URL and hazard a guess.
				<li>Added a new SLIMP3 Remote application for controlling the playback of the SLIMP3 from a Mac OS X desktop. Thanks to Dave Camp for this contribution.
			</ul>
			<li>Player Interface:
			<ul>
				<li>Added a screen dimming feature. If the player is on, but not playing and not animating, dim the screen until the next IR input. Even though we've never seen any burn-in, this should make some folks more comfortable.
				<li>Optimize playing the Nth song in a playlist from the remote. It was really slow.
				<li>Fixed a a bug where the server could crash when two players are synced and a new song starts.
				<li>Add All Albums and All Songs browsing so you can see a list of all the albums associated with a given Genre or all of the songs listed for a given artist. Particularly useful for compilation albums.
				<li>Default to having a second level Search menu. You can also disable this from the prefs and put the individual search menus back on the top level.
				<li>When displaying the file length, put in commas/periods to make large numbers readable.
				<li>Corrected separators in short date formats.
				<li>When the user browses with the remote and chooses a song in the context of an album, we start playing the whole album starting at that song. To be consistent, we now also play all of the songs in a given directory if you browse in that directory, choose a song and press PLAY. (Note: we don't recurse in this situation, we only look at songs at the current level. If you want to recurse, choose the directory and press PLAY.)
				<li>Added support for pressing PLAY or REC when in the search screens. It will now automatically play or add the search results to the playlist.
				<li>Richard Purdie's cool fix for the streaming CPU hogging bug.
				<li>Added basic support for fast forward and rewind by pressing and holding the FWD and REW keys.
				<li>Included the submitted patch from Gregory Smith that ignores leading articles (The Le Les La Las Los...) for sorting only. You can change which articles to ignore in the advanced settings area.
				<li>Added a volume area to settings. Now you can almost completely control the IR interface with six buttons: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, PLAY, REC
				<li>Added support for multiple IR code sets, including the codeset for our new remote.
				<li>Added BASS and TREBLE controls to the Settings menu, based on a patch from Richard Purdie.
				<li>When browsing an album or a directory via the remote and you press play on a song, it plays the whole album, starting at that point.
				<li>Reworked the IR settings file. There's one file per remote IR code set, so we can handle multiple remotes by adding new .ir files. These files contain IR code to button mappings. New remotes that respond to new codes should have corresponding .ir files created for them.
				<li>There's a new file, Default.map, in the IR directory that contains the button to function mappings. Intrepid users who want to remap the buttons on their remote can modify this file to their liking.
			</ul>
			<li>Web Interface
			<ul>
				<li>Add All Albums and All Songs browsing so you can see a list of all the albums associated with a given Genre or all of the songs listed for a given artist. Particularly useful for compilation albums.
				<li>Added a facility to serve the raw music files via HTTP: Like this: http://myserver:9000/music/virtual/path/to/song.mp3 Only works with songs.
				<li>Fixed many cases where you'd get the funny nested frame problem due to bugs in Opera and Safari.
				<li>Added an HTML template directive: [INCLUDE html/path/here.html] will include the parsed contents of the file in html/path/here.html in the output. Subroutines!
				<li>Hide directory entries that start with __ including our __current.m3u file
				<li>Fixed a couple of it's that should have been its.
				<li>When displaying the file length, put in commas/periods to make large numbers readable.
				<li>Added support for mDNS/Zeroconf/Rendezvous advertising of the SLIMP3 services. Initially supports OS X and one flavor of Linux.
				<li>Changing playlist request through stream.mp3 to match regular syntax. Now use: http://slimserver:9000/stream.mp3?p0=playlist&amp;=load&amp;=playlistpath.m3u&amp; The final &amp; is so that WinAmp doesn't choke on it and is ignored by us. Playlistpath can be an URL escaped full path, an iTunes playlist URL (URL escaped), or a naked playlist name from the Saved Playlist directory.
				<li>Added x-p0 through x-p4 to the HTTP headers in responses to that you can query and get information using the executecommand() syntax, also used by the CLI.
				<li>Added a &quot;Previous&quot; button on the status page.
				<li>Sorting of artists albums and song titles ignores articles like &quot;The&quot; and &quot;La&quot;. You can change which articles to ignore in the advanced settings area.
				<li>Added ability to move items in the playlist around in the Moser skin.
				<li>Added new advanced settings page for setting debug variables
				<li>When looking at song information from the web interface, return a valid URL for songs, even if they are file URLs.
				<li>Return the values of p0 through p4 as headers in HTTP responses. Useful for using HTTP for interactive control. Also return the selected player name and id
				<li>When you start to play music from the web interface, power up if it's powered off.
				<li>You can download music files from the server using a path like: http://server/Music/path/to/song.mp3
				<li>Added support for multiple skins simultaneously. http://server:9000/Moser/ will show the Moser skin automatically.
			</ul>
			<li>Documentation and Online Help
			<ul>
				<li>Updated FAQ and documentation
				<li>Updated the HTTP documentation for new and previously undocumented commands.
				<li>The technical documentation had references to a command called appendalbum, but it's really called addalbum.
				<li>First pass at merging the FAQ on the website with the FAQ in the documentation. This will also appear on the web site. Needs a new index and more organization.
				<li>Added a FAQ entry identifying the ports that are used so that folks can configure their firewalls more easily.
				<li>Updated the FAQ with a bunch of, you guessed it, frequently asked questions.
			</ul>
			<li>File Formats
			<ul>
				<li>No longer recursing into playlists during scans. We may need a power-user option for this, but the new behavior will help more people than it hurts.
				<li>Improved Ogg Vorbis transcoding support. You need to have the Ogg tools and LAME installed for this to work. Only tested on Unix.
				<li>Adding support for the ID3 tags that describe the album number and number of albums in a multi-disc set, in the same manner that we do for iTunes importing.
				<li>The IR code format was messed up in the previous release, it's fixed, but if you've created custom IR files, you'll have to update them.
			</ul>
			<li>Internationalization and Localization
			<ul>
				<li>Swedish and Danish localizations from Andreas Olsson and Morten Fischer-Madsen
				<li>Andreas found some strings that weren't localizable.
				<li>Improved Dutch Localization courtesy Carel Blast
			</ul>
			<li>Linux/Solaris/Unix:
			<ul>
				<li>Fixed an occasional warning from the Animation module.
				<li>Added FreeBSD notes to the Installation.txt docs.
				<li>Patch from datavortex: changed account to a system account and shell to nologin. - don't add user with default name if the admin changed it.
				<li>When running the server in daemon mode, rename the process &quot;slimp3d&quot;
			</ul>
			<li>Command-line interface:
			<ul>
				<li>Added and documented the &quot;exit&quot; command to the CLI. Closes the connection.
				<li>Added new command line argument, --stdio, which enables CLI interface on standard in/out. Now you can safely put the server into the background from a shell.
			</ul>
			<li>Player Firmware
			<ul>
				<li>Added command line options to update_firmware to specify IP and MAC in interactive mode.
				<li>Calling the latest firmware 2.0b2.
				<li>SliMP3's MAC is now in bytes 12..17 of our UDP header
				<li>Added support for multiple IR code sets, including the codeset for our new remote.
				<li>Pressing and holding the POWER button for a long time (15 seconds) will reboot the player now, so you don't have to unplug the unit to reconfigure.
				<li>Improved the user interface for network settings on the player. You can use the number buttons to enter digits in IP values, use UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT consistently throught the interface, use FWD and REW to skip forward and back a screen at a time.

		<h2><a name="v3.0" id="v3.0">Version 3.0 final, Released 2002-11-12</a></h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Mac OS X:
			<ul>
				<li>Fixed a problem where URLs in iTunes playlists were being ignored.
				<li>Fixed a problem where we were showing internal &quot;iTunesPlaylist:&quot; URLs where we shouldn't.
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Player Interface:
			<ul>
				<li>The sleep button wasn't working properly in double-height mode. The text was on the top line, so you wouldn't see it.
				<li>When displaying a file name, correctly separate file and extension.
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Web Interface
			<ul>
				<li>Added a FAQ to the online documentation.
				<li>Improved the Moser skin. Now the arrow links look like buttons. Note that the button appearance looks a ton better in Mozilla 1.1 and IE 5.5 than it does in IE 5.01.
				<li>Added an additional server setting to allow sorting and browsing by file name instead of ID3 tag information. (This was added in b7, but the release notes weren't updated.)
				<li>Fixed some problems in HTML with the documentation.
				<li>Fixed some problems in HTML with the &quot;page bar&quot; listings.
				<li>Fixed a capitalization issue with &quot;Player Settings&quot;
				<li>Minor editing to some of the other help documents.
				<li>Redid the Getting Started help document based on the new getting started flyer.
				<li>Added a {webroot} parameter to the templates for easier absolute references. This is set to &quot;/SLIMP3&quot; if a request comes in with /SLIMP3 as the start of the path. This eliminates the need to use updirs &quot;..&quot; in the on-line documentation. It also corrects some invalid (to people using the /SLIMP3 prefix) absolute references which were pre-existing.
				<li>Fixed all color references in CSS files.
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>File Formats
			<ul>
				<li>Fixed a problem where only &quot;http://&quot; URLs were working in PLS files.

			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Internet Radio/Streaming
			<ul>
				<li>Fixed a problem where redirected URLs for streams were losing their title.
				<li>Fixed a problem where URLs redirected through PLS files were losing their title.

			<li>Command-line interface:
			<ul>
				<li>Added --nosetup startup parameter. This disables setup from the web pages, as well as anything that uses Playlist::executecommand with a p0 of pref. When --nosetup is used on the command line, the settings pages are not linked from home, and if they are explicitly requested a 403 Forbidden is returned.

				<li>The SLIMP3 Server executable couldn't kill the server process on Win98 because 98 puts the process name in all upper case. It can now.
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Mac OS X:
			<ul>
				<li>Enable support for Composer field (as an additional artist) for iTunes users.
				<li>When we are scanning the iTunes library, don't tell the user they can browse the music library, because they can't.
				<li>Fixed a problem with the ID3 library where iTunes has some ID3 tags that have spaces in the tag name. We now allow a space.
				<li>Fixed a problem in iTunes where multi-line comments would cause the parser to get confused.
				<li>New users get a reasonable default for the path to their Music Library and their Playlist folder. (Namely: /Users/name/Music/ for both).
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Player interface:
			<ul>
				<li>Fixed a problem where pressing STOP didn't always stop the playback immediately.
				<li>Some work on the garbage display bug. We now correctly force the display back into 8 bit mode with every display update. If the bug happens in a particular frame, it will be repaired in the next frame.
				<li>When a new song starts, stop any scrolling and animation for all synced players so that the correct song information is displayed.
				<li>Fixed a cosmetic bug that happend with double-sized characters when the first character was an S.
				<li>Improved the display code to reduce the amount of processing, and number of bytes sent (especially when there's a cursor). There's still a bug somewhere (maybe in the VFD display itself) where the cursor flashes randomly on the screen occasionally.
				<li>Fixed the Welcome To SLIMP3 screen to work again when the server or the player restarts.
				<li>Fixed a problem where changing the brightness when in double-sized broke.
				<li>Fixing the double-height right arrow, K and N characters.
				<li>Fixed (I think) a problem where we were sometimes dropping stop and pause commands.
				<li>Clean up the custom character code to handle all possible bitmaps, improve performance (a bit), and never send bogus data to the player.
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Web Interface
			<ul>
				<li>If the songs in a specified album have duplicate track numbers, then sort by artist first. This makes &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; work out better. If there are not duplicate track numbers, then sort by track number first, which makes compilation albums sort properly.
				<li>If there are two albums with the same title, sort the songs by artist first.
				<li>Removed Games setting in Advanced Server settings, as it isn't needed. Use the new Home menu editing facility.
				<li>Don't show duplicate songs in albums.
				<li>Fixed a broken link to the CLI documentation.
				<li>Fix a typo that made searching for songs via the web interface crash the server.
				<li>Fixed a missing space in the playlist template for songs.
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>File formats
			<ul>
				<li>Included the patch to support YEAR GENRE and COMMENT in CUE files.
				<li>Clean up of caching of track data to make CUE files work a little better.
				<li>CUE file entries weren't going into the genre cache. Now they are.
				<li>There are a couple of situations where we mean to merge in new meta information not replace it altogether. So now we do that.
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Internet Radio/Streaming
			<ul>
				<li>Fixed shoutcast metadata display.
				<li>Fixed HTTP streaming (from the SLIMP3 server) to work reliably.
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Linux/Solaris/Unix:
			<ul>
				<li>Included submitted solaris build information by Mike Arnold.
				<li>Included submitted patch for relocatable RPM support by Mike Arnold.
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Command Line Options &amp; Debugging Tools
			<ul>
				<li>Added better backtrace output.
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>HTTP and Command Line Interface Automation
			<ul>
				<li>Return a content type for status.txt of text/plain
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Firmware
			<ul>
				<li>Updated firmware to version 1.3b2 to fix possible problems with corrupted display data
				<li>Removed display init on sleep wakeup
				<li>Removed LCD_CLEAR when displaying ICMP unreachable
				<li>Changed LCD packet parsing to check for ==0x02 or ==0x03, instead of just checking the two last bits. Removed support for the wait command.
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Miscellaneous
			<ul>
				<li>The ends of songs were being cut off when we had mulitple players synced. We should allow for quite a few chunks of silence to be pre-queued when resyncing at the end of song.
				<li>Fixed the display of all LATIN1 characters. We don't have a full character set in the player, so we map as closely as possible.
				<li>Disabling UTF8 support for now. It wasn't making things much better.
				<li>Calculate the content type from the path name unless we've already got one. This fixes some problems with saving playlists.
				<li>A variety of performance optimizations to reduce overall CPU usage.
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<h2><a name="v3.0b5">Version 3.0b5, Released 2002-10-01</a></h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Windows:
			<ul>
				<li>Fixed a problem where Windows .lnk files wouldn't work properly.
				<li>The Windows shell application now can quit and leave the server running. There's a new preference for this as well as a menu choice to set it. This choice is confirmed if you have confirm turned on.
				<li>Use the &quot;Bagpuss&quot; look as the default on Windows.
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Mac OS X:
			<ul>
				<li>The OS X application now shows the status of the server (on or off) by changing the icon on the dock and on the SLIMP3 Server main window.
				<li>Fixed a problem where if a user was using the iTunes importing feature,they couldn't browse their saved playlists unless they turned off iTunes support and then turned it on again.
				<li>The OS X application menus were cleaned up. There's now a menu choice and keyboard equivalent to start and stop the server.
				<li>The OS X application automatically starts the server when it launches.
				<li>iTunes users now get their iTunes playlists along with the other saved playlists. These are read-only, due to the one-way importing of the iTunes library information.
				<li>Somehow the firmware updater menu got disabled in the OS X application. Re-enabled it.
				<li>The OS X application displays the server status more reliably.
				<li>iTunes gets unhappy (and starts ripping songs as &quot;Uknown&quot; if you keep its library file open when it tries to write to it. So we open it and read the whole darned thing in at once and then parse it from memory. Which is faster anyways.
				<li>Warn the user that scanning is still happening for iTunes too.
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Player interface:
			<ul>
				<li>Bingo! Killed the garbage character bug that was plaguing 1.3b4 firmware. The problem wasn't in the firmware, rather the server was sending a control code t that was causing some problems on the client. Removed that code and as a bonus, cleaned up how we send brightness commands.
				<li>Jeff Bain submitted some tweaks to the double-size characters and layout. Lookin' good!
				<li>Fixing bugs in synchronization: Unsyncing the master was broken, unsyncing sometimes didn't stop the audio right away.
				<li>Rework the 1.3 streaming code to stall out less often. We also stop scanning (and other background tasks) if the client's buffer runs below half full.
				<li>Disable repeated buttons, including Volume when the player is &quot;off&quot;.
				<li>Fixed a problem where pressing pause in quick succession would cause things to lock up badly.
				<li>Saved Playlists should come right after Music Library from the remote.
				<li>Fade out when we sleep...
				<li>Disable the syncing of HTTP clients, as it doesn't really work.
				<li>Add song information about which ID3 tags we are using.
				<li>Improved animation behavior under load. We now skip frames when appropriate and check the timers before and after handling client streaming.
				<li>Turn the timeout used by the streaming protocol for the 1.3 firmware way down so the queue doesn't stall for so long when we drop a packet.
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Web Interface
			<ul>
				<li>Fixed a problem added in 3.0b5 that would sometimes show a &quot;please set up your playlists&quot; screen when trying to save the current playlist.
				<li>Updated the sorting used when browsing the music library so it sorts by artist, album, track number and title, in that order.
				<li>We no longer throttle the scan, so we shouldn't tell the user that we do in the advanced server settings.
				<li>Fixed a word in the text displayed when the server doesn't know about any player.
				<li>You can now customize the Home menu int the &quot;Additional Server Settings&quot; area, courtesy RMoser.
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Internet Radio/Streaming
			<ul>
				<li>On occasion, streaming radio connections were left open for a long time. Consolidated the closing of open files and streams to fix this.
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Linux/Unix:
			<ul>
				<li>RPM: make sure the new slimp3 user doesn't have a home directory
				<li>SLIMP3 lives in /usr/local not /usr/local/bin for the RPMs
				<li>Try and load a system Time::HiRes before the local version.
				<li>We keep around the server scripts when building a release for zipping and tarring.
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Command Line Options &amp; Debugging Tools
			<ul>
				<li>Added --streamaddr and --playeraddr command line options to allow the caller to specify which interface to listen on for remote streaming and player UDP.
				<li>Fixed a bug where we weren't keeping track of the last time we went through the idle loop properly.
				<li>Added a bunch of additional debugging output to make monitoring of timing and performance easier.
				<li>Include the d_stream debug flag for debugging the new streaming protocol.
				<li>--d_sync Added a synch debugging flag.
				<li>Added the ability to turn on/off debugging flags from the command line interface. This isn't useful from the remote interface but is very useful from stdio.
				<li>Expose --d_stream_v for verbose stream debugging info. --d_usage shows a 0-9 digit in the rightmost part of the display on 1.3 and a 2 byte hex code on the left on 1.2. We also spit out a percentage to stderr on 1.3
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>HTTP and Command Line Interface Automation
			<ul>
				<li>Updated the CLI documentation to explain the &quot;rescan&quot; (old) and &quot;path&quot; (new) commands. Added the path command to the CLI.
				<li>Fixed a bug that was causing us to ignore parameters after the pause command which we hardly ever used.
				<li>If you put up some text on the screen with the HTTP or CLI interface for longer than a few seconds, the screen would blank and possibly get corrupted. Not anymore.
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Miscellaneous
			<ul>
				<li>Firmware files now include version number.
				<li>Updated the pronto CCF file.
				<li>Fixed harmless warning about empty responses when we were sending empty reponses.
				<li>Basic unicode support is enabled.
				<li>Sometimes we were giving some warnings with bad ID3 tags when we tried to get the utf8 version of strings.
				<li>We weren't caching unknown file types, so we would keep trying to figure it out over and over even though we tried once already. This could slow us down a lot.
				<li>Richard Purdie submitted a patch to use a file called ~/.slimp3-strings.txt (on unix) or slimp3-strings.txt (on windows, in the same directory as your prefs file) to override some or all of the standard strings in the strings.txt file. Uses the same format.
